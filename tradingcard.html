                        Kylie is a Maltese dog.The Maltese is a small and affectionate toy dog breed that hails from the Mediterranean region and is known for its trademark silky, white fur that accentuates its big, dark eyes. 
                        It can make for a charming lapdog, though it does still need daily exercise. 
                        The Maltese also can be an alert and fearless watchdog, despite its small size. 
                        Plus, it can be a good option for those who want a low-shedding dog, though it does require some involved grooming.
